    <h3 style ="text-align:center;">(the future)</h3><p1>


        When the waters finally reach our balcony, silence is falling over the new oceans. The future has become a quiet time. The day is bright and gentle - a light rain drizzles from the fluffy clouds above and the waves trickle gently into this house that we have destroyed.</p1> 
        <p2>You reveal your final trump card from your sleeve – just like when you first produced a white mouse for me from the depths of your jacket pockets. It transpires that our four post bed converts easily into a luxury life raft. You hid that well, my love. I thought our passage would be aboard the wooden piece of junk we had kept nailed to the walls of the library. Now I see that that was only just a ruse.</p2>


We load it down with the last of the supplies in the pantry. Then I take my rum glass and I christen the boat by smashing the glass upon the hull.
-Now I have broken the last of the rum glasses, I say. Just as I have gone and broken myself.
Then we just have to open the balcony doors and hoist it out.
-There are mountains on the horizon, Matthew points out to us. You can see them far, far away, now that the smog has started to clear.
He turns to urinate happily on our billion yuan couch of greater luxury. We wait for him, then together we push our little bed boat out on to the swell. 
There are indeed mountains on the horizon. There are further mountains too, I am sure, beyond the mountains whose crooked peaks we can see. Maybe they are the Himalayas. I genuinely do not know where I am anymore. There is also one of those big fuck-off rainbows above us. It's the kind of rainbow I had always thought was only found in fairy tales.
-Onwards Comrades, you declare. We are leaving to found a garden state.
-For the millionth time... I begin to slur.
-Heigh ho, heigh ho, cries Matthew.
He plays a little ditty on his flute and, surely enough, the mice, in their hundreds, emerge from all of the many corners in which they have been hiding. In an orderly march they line up and begin to hop on board. George, Hermione and Ginger stand proudly by the stern, while their countless descendents take up their positions on the hull, joining us for our final voyage.

I am knocked back once more by the image of you two human beings, standing so replete in your sailor caps. I am shaken by your resilience and I am over powered by the extent of your nerve. I am so proud of your two bodies, your minds, your spirits. I am destroyed by you and him, both of you, having the audacity to actually exist.


<p>-You are all for real? I ask, and now it's like I must pinch myself to make sure that I won't just wake up – that you too won't both just begin to crumble away before me.
For a long moment you look like you will say something, yet in the end all you do is wink and laugh.
-Excelsior! shouts Matthew. Excelsior!
    Of course I am still very much drunk, yet the rain is coming down softly, and as we venture once more into the broken world, what is left of us is coming apart. I am beginning to shake uncontrollably. There is water, and in no particular direction it is carrying various forms of debris. All that is to be found out here is now ocean and confetti.</p> 

<p>-Excelsior!, we cry as one, as we push the boat off, and go once more to the world. 
    -Excelsior!</p>


        <p>We were born at the end of history. Well, now this is the end of that end. We became a virus, a glorious lunatic cancer on the face of the earth. Lady of our time, have you never heard it said - that under heaven, even the bawdiest of revelles doesn't quite last? That was what Matthew told me - when he was mad eyed and wandering – all those long years ago. Well I do not know. Maybe you will have to pinch yourself too. Maybe you have been in doubt as well, this whole time, as regards to the moon representing our hearts, and as to the laughing constitution of our being. I do not know. I do not understand you. I will never understand you. Or I refuse to understand, and all I know now is this:</p>

        <p>For a minute here in time, on our little ship of clowns, it's like we're the only three friends left alive in the world.</p><
