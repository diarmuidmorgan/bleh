I did some writing over the years, and I thought I'd do a personal webpage for a personal project, plus a little blog where nothing is written.I don't know about the questionable color scheme and layout, but hey I'm not really into design. I guess I was going for kind of tacky hyper schizo-art-deco. It is a grim experience reading 'personal webpages' on the web, so I tried to make the content on mine as bizarre and self-deprecating as possible.

I engaged with point (4) of the assignment in following ways:
Trys to make use of responsive design. Please resize the window to see. The navigation bar collapses into a menu button when the screen becomes small enough, and the 'Confetti.' logo swaps between three different sizes. I tried applying this three size design to the rest of the webpage with mixed results. I feel there must be a better way of doing a gallery than simply warping all of the images to fit the same box, but I don't know how to use photoshop so sadly this is what I went with.


Though not explicitly stated as a way to gain extra credit, my page also incorporates some basic javascript on the 'blog' and 'images' pages. The basic java script allows one to switch through the images in the gallery. On the blog page, the blog posts are actually loaded, and formatted into html, from an array in the script blog/blogscript.txt. Obviously this isn't how it's done on a real website where I guess php or something would be used to retrieve content, but I thought it was worth experimenting with.

I have commented wherever I feel I have taken code from elsewhere - and as you'll see in the markup, there are a lot of these instances! These are places where I felt like I would have copied code from w3schools at one stage or another, and either changed/added attributes, or completely rewritten it with the same template in mind. I have tried to include links to original sources in these comments.



Stole the "." after confetti from the "Simply." example given to us in class!
