It is so strange now, to think of them all. When the tsunamis came down upon the sky cities, we were surrounded by suits on the roof of a Financial Tower. It was the same day that growth in our part of the world had been declared vertical, and they could not find enough champagne bottles to uncork, nor enough enough prostitutes to come and attend. I was so busy being harrassed into doing more deals, that I barely noticed the arrival of the tsunamis.<br><br>
 
-Fuck off, I kept telling the suits. I was at a little table with my gin and tonic glass. I was watching my fortune grow on my computer terminal, and I could barely hear what they were proposing. I must have been a very popular deal maker back then, for they were all shouting and clawing at each other – competing for what limited attention I had devoted neither to my fortune nor my gin and tonic glass.  The sound of Italo was already so loud, booming out across the metropolis, and I was beginning to grow sick of doing business, consisting as it did of staring at a laptop and being harrassed day and night. So I was not particularly unhappy when the tsunamis arrived.<br><br>

You heard them first. There was a warm and deep rumble from the horizon.  The sky itself began to shudder, and they had to cut the music so that we could begin to figure out what was going on.
-Come! Look! You said, gripping my hand.<br><br>
You led me to the edge of the roof, where a small crowd was already gathering. Their jaws were dropping with their glasses onto the terrace. You wore a triumphant smile. I looked out to see them approaching – the great walls of water and rubbish, heaving towards us at five hundred miles per hour.<br><br>
-Well, you said. This is indeed the most remarkable of possible timelines. Who would have thought – a decade ago – that we would actually be right about everything after all?<br><br>
Then you went to a frightened waiter and got us two more gin and tonics. You yelled at the DJ to turn the music back on. Returning, you held my hand and laughed in my face.<br><br>
-You're so silly, you said, noticing my shaking hands. Don't worry. Don't worry about anything at all.<br><br>
Then we began to slow dance amongst the commotion. The suits were knocking over glasses and tables in their scramble to get to their phones and their computer terminals. Everywhere, deals and dinner plates were being abandoned upon the floor. We danced, and as the waves hit our metropoli, the tower tremored upon it's foundations. I noticed for the millionth time the depths of your eyes. Sometimes they were blue, and sometimes they were green, but on that day they were a wonderfully deep kind of grey.<br><br>

This has been, indeed, the most remarkable of possible timelines.  Then, on that rooftop, it was impossible to tell who had been wrong from who had been right, and despite our travels, I found I had no idea whereabouts in the world we were. Geographically speaking, we were still situated in some amorphous location on the cold body of a rock. I smiled, for it occurred to me that that rock spun around and around in space, while I twirled you faster in spirals to the sound of disco and apparoaching walls of water - walls that were half a mile high.<br><br>

Pleased, we watched the demand for our lifeboats soar once again – though it was very difficult to do anything in the way of vending, all things considered. One cannot sell what one cannot locate. One cannot sell to those who have nothing to pay with. The radio waves and the live feeds all resolved into a chorus of despair, as we walked home to our sky villa upon the sky bridges that would soon become water tunnels beneath the sea. In our high chambers, we ignored everything, playing records and drinking more gin and tonics into the evening. We called various meetings, to which few straddlers were able to arrive. Either way, we quickly fired anyone who actually showed up. Within in two days, we had wrapped up most of our remaining interests.<br><br>

Night was almost upon us then. We watched the horizon, and not a small number of rocket ships were on the ascendant. We could tell by the great trails of smoke that they left hanging below the calm and brilliant blue firmanent. We deliberated upon hiring a rocket ship of our own, and setting forth for a latter day journey amidst the stars . We would go and discover whether the planets really all had different characters, and if a small portion of the moon might indeed be made out of cheese. But there was nothing up there to head for, Matthew assured us. There was only the silence and the incertitude of the void. The mice, as it were, would struggle to adapt to zero gravity.<br><br>
-Well, good riddance you said.<br><br>

So we settled here then, in this hanging palace that we had stocked ahead of the curve, with our neighbors who have, like us, lost almost everything they ever had. The life boats leaving the sky cities provided quite a spectacle, as the millions took to the seas in search of drier pastures. That mass exodus was a disaster on a whole other scale, and it took us along while to begin to fathom just what it was we had done.<br><br>
-They should have tested them, I believe Blatthy told me, on one of those first afternoons when we had him down for cognac. That was their duty as consumers. You were offering refunds, I am sure.<br><br>
-And what of our duty as manufacturers?<br><br>
-Alas, he said. In times like these, nobody is wholly in the right.<br><br>

We were not like them, I guess – the drowning hoardes, the dying masses, the pitiable sea borne refugees of the earth. That is definitive. That is regrettable. But it's just the way it was. We had long since ascended into the clouds – for better, or worse, and disregarding the possibility of the rocket ships, we had taken the only train that was left.<br>

This, today, was the eve of Tomb Sweeping, a long standing tradition in these parts. Things were going to change – and change definitively, and tonight it was like that grey anvil above our heads finally fell. We sat over a pithy meal of rice and canned spinach, in our dining room that is starting to cook amidst the heat.<br><br> 
-To all those departed, Matthew said, as he held the wine glass up before us, and then mumbled an indecipherable prayer. For all those who went to the world.<br><br>
-It could not have been any different, you said.<br><br>
-No, he said. Not this time around.<br><br>
            -No, I echoed. Not this time around.</p><br><br><br>
