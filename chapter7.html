Life rolls by unhindered now, on our gloomy plateau. This morning though, I lay beside you with a wine glass in my hands. We had had guests. I had not enjoyed having guests – finding them for the most part rather rude and irksome in conversation. Now it was late, I think, yet there were witches still congregating and smoking cigarettes outside the orgy that was taking place in our drawing room. You were curled up beside me, and there was a look of impossible happiness beneath the locks that almost covered your sleeping face. <br><br>
The orgy was finishing. I could still hear the lull breaking over the low key stockbroker discotheque. I had not, I must admit, felt altogether great at the orgy. I mean I had enjoyed, somewhat, the view of what was unfolding, from the safety of where we reclined in the shadows. But as a spiritual experience it had left me numb. It had not begun to kindle any kind of jouissance, as you said, in my loins, and I was forced to glug through two bottles just to keep calm during the three hours for which we stayed.<br><br>
I was recovering then, stroking you hair, and listening to the pigeons nesting outside. Happily, I hawked back my glass in the late morning. I began to feel so good about everything that I decided to invade your dreams. It was, I thought, worth one last shot. I had tried many times before, of course. I do not know if it was some kind of spell the witches had placed me under, or if I have just had invading on my mind of late - but now I was filled with a resolve that I had not felt before. I lay beside you and held your hand – to speed the synchronicity of our minds. I closed my eyes, and through a valley mouth I could glimpse your white fortress on a hill.<br><br>
The sunset was pink calamity – the land beyond the canyon was rocky and well suited to your guerilla tactics. I was undeterred. My Viking armies sounded their mammoth horns, and I marched upon you. You sent forth your drone bombs and self-immolators to waylay my progress. I danced past them – although my swordsmen were crudely decimated upon the rocks. Then you positioned your ninjas and your harpies, your last of the Reich and your Mongol hordes. I unleashed my pygmies and my Stakhanovites, and such carnage never before has the world truly seen.
Nearing your keep, you panicked and you emptied harems of nubile beauty to try and tempt me from my path.<br><br> I was not tempted – not in the slightest, although many of my generals followed their siren song into the woods and the bushes. There they were devoured by lizards and man eating trees. For myself, I saw only the question that lay unanswered behind your towering pearly gates. I knocked one hundred and fifty times upon your door. I howled and I cried. I banged till my elbows ached and my hands bled, yet there was only your silence, your pots of burning oil and your projectiles. From my flanks I trundled forth the battering rams, the cannons, the terrible siege engines that I had assembled out of sticks and stones.<br><br>
Inside there were only dusty corridors, and imperial halls filled with the glaring effigies of mice. I could not stop. I hurried then, to the top of your highest tower. But I knew already what I would find – your tangled locks crafted into one enormous braid and tied hurriedly to the bedpost – the chord disappearing through the only window – the window out of which you had long since vanished. For a moment I felt a total fear that, but for those locks, it might have been someone else, not you, all along guiding this defense.<br><br>
You woke me with your warmth and your pressure, your body straggling mine in the fading light. The bed sheets had not done well from my glass of wine. Once again, my face was a puffy mess. You were feeling me with a quizzical eye.<br><br>
-Soft evening, City! You declared.<br><br>
There was some truth in that. Though the itch in the curtains, the receding storm played out its colored memories upon your face. It was all not really like that other, golden morning, all of those years ago, when you invaded my sleep with your lips – when I slept feverishly and you woke me with kisses and warmth for that shaking December cold.<br><br>
The night preceding that morning in question – What a time it had been! I had eaten so many of the pink sickle tablets that I kept flopping over on the dance floor. By the fire escape I would keep forgetting which part of the truth I was meant to be telling. You too, were in some kind of glistening funk. I would only hold you close – stealing winter comfort – and disappear in your embrace.<br><br>
Nothing will ever be like that again – I know this now. That innocence is well and truly brutalized. But when you woke me like that – after I had failed, once again, to lay claim upon your dreams – it was still something similar and it did indeed make me sleepily smile.</p><br><br><br>
