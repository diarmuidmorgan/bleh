True love<b>
 does not,<b>
lend itself to silence<b>
yet it feels not<b>
compelled<b>
to announce its immanence,<b>
in the moment<b>
of its departure<b>
True love<b>
 does not,<b>
remain here all morning,<b>
coming down on<b>
the sofa and,<b>
while the rain continues<b>
true love <b>
does not listen<b>
to the rain petering out<b>
or to whatever<b>
the fuck<b>
the speakers might play<b><b>

True love<b>
 does not<b>
listen to Leyland Kirby, nor does it<b>
hammer on <b>
stark piano drones<b>
and<b>
True love<b>
 does not love to read you aloud<b>
your Nietzche, and<b>
True love does not love<b>
to annotate your<b>
Jean Genet<b>
True love<b>
 does<b>
not count itself in our final fumbling<b>
waltzes,<b>
our spilt wine, our fears and our shattered glasses<b>
True love<b>
 holds no challenge to<b>
parting kisses, or singular pearl like<b>
tears.<b>
True love<b>
 does not wait,<b>
for this hour, before the sun has<b>
fully risen——<b>
True love<b>
 does not keep<b>
a ledger, and so<b>
true love<b>
 does not calculate,<b>
the tremendous total of it's silence,<b> 
or the baffling number<b>
of our<b>
dreamy silent days<b><b>
True love<b>
 leaves no traces,<b>
no messages, and<b>
no debris<b>
All that <b>
true love<b>
 leaves is its truth, and its<b>
only truth,<b>
is that it has left,<b>
just as if <b>
to restate that——<b>
all along<b>
it was sovereign<b>
and all along<b>
it was<b>
 free.<b>
