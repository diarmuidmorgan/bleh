        <p class='contentbox'>Harrietta of the highlands. Hilde from the valley below. Helen of Troy. Honor. Hate. I will call you Harmony. That name, somehow, seems to fit.<br><br> And so it is, Harmony – just like you always said it would be.<br><br>
We will always and eventually reach a point where there is nothing left to do but stop. No more routes present themselves. We have forgotten by which pathway we arrived. Then it is always the same. It is time for us to throw everything away. We must leave behind now these uncertain stepping stones -  if there is to be any chance of starting anew. If some token of love, or hope, reveals itself while we are sifting through this debris of our lives, then maybe that'll be something.<br><br>
We are still all of the names in History. How? We were born at the end of history. I do not know for certain where they might have found you. I only know that they found me in a dustbin – I fell out with the rest of the rubbish, when they were in the process of throwing away the dustbins themselves. They cleaned me up – this dustbin child. They taught me to read their words and to speak in their tongues. They showed me how I might stand upright in spite of my crooked back. They brought me, rose cheeked, to their Sunday morning masses. Slowly I learned the skill by which to measure the value of their fifty pound bank notes, and to judge when it was safe to crawl or stumble across their streets. Soon I knew with which hand to hold my knife, and with which to hold my fork. I studied, and I learned all of this so well that, at last, I began to forget that there had been any instruction involved.<br><br>
By your account, they must have pulled you from a melting snowdrift – they with their hunting rifles who were out slaying the various creatures of the wild. They brought you home to their cabins, and from that humble beginning onwards, you were a difficult case. You would not concede to be taught their categories for things and their convictions about the world. So they left you alone in the old library, to grow up untethered with the mice and the dusty tomes of samizdat literature that piled the book cases there in. From the books you began to deduce the rules and etiquette of the game they were playing with you – and yet from the same books you learned never to concede. I mean only that your heart was never in it – they could never teach your heart of hearts that there was profit to be had in its own demise.<br><br>
We were born at the end of History. That is the first lesson to which we were present. That is to say that we were born on the cusp of a great promise – their promise. From the moment of our first hot bubble baths, we were part of something far greater than we could reliably perceive – at that age, knowledgeable only of sights and sounds and strange ambrosia scents – we were the promised children – destined to live out the full weight of another's lofty dream.<br><br>
So we lived. We were angelic, and at the same moment we were demonic too. They named you Harmony, and after a time they tempted you away from the mice and the piles of manuscripts whose value you were only beginning to comprehend. They put me on a bus and sent me daily to a redbrick fortress of manners and mauve sweaters, there to be educated surrounded by car horn ash and dahlila trees. They put you in their sleighs, and in awe you were shown the secret passages used to navigate the ice walls. When summer came, they took us to see the highways – took us to the places where you could see only the highways, burning crisp and black out to where the mountains met the road - and only imagine where they may have ended or begun.<br><br>
Yet something went wrong, though what it was I do not know. I feel as if we must have swooned in the August heat. We fell and we cracked our ears upon the tarmac, and when we pulled ourselves back to our feet everything had changed. They were no longer the same highways, and those who had led us there were gone. They had folded into the mirage. Neither were we the same – for all we could see was empty horizon and all we could smell was fresh tarmacadam burning with dust, and all we could hear was this sound of another world ringing in our eardrums.
We were younger then, but I think we have hardly changed at all. We are taller, but we are unsteady in our gait. Our faces have grown longer, yet our shoulders still ache. You stood in the haze, this afternoon, on the gargoyled terrace abutting our chambers. You were naked but for the rainfall that cloaked your skin. You were defiant, and to me you declared:<br><br>
-Our rage, when it comes, will not be justified. Neither will it be proportionate. Our rage will in fact be completely without a sense of proportion. Our intentions will not be noble. Our actions, will be described only in the terms in which they present themselves – as obscenities. Nothing more and nothing less.
Then you yelled the word 'fuck' at the faces in the gathering storm clouds, and when you yelled, your voice carried all the weight of the past thousand rainy afternoons.<br><br>
I brought you in, and you let me swaddle you in warm towels. I filled your flask with hot water, lemon, ginger and chrysanthemum. I reminded you that it did not matter, all things considered. You demanded that I go, then, to our heavy oaken chest of treasures, and root out our contract, which you were sure you had seen lying around in there. I complied, though I did so with a heavy heart. I brought the contract to you, all fifty tightly pressed pages, and then I rested crosslegged on the bed, while you took to the windowstill and determinedly read the whole thing over from back to front.<br><br>
We had penned the contract while the lifeboat business was exploding. That's how we refer to our once enormous wealth - the life boat business. It had become apparent that the life boat business was moving beyond our individual control, and the contract had come to be important in the face of strenuous legal challenges. It had, in commendable and flowery script, codified a few things like shared entrance rights to our vault in the sky bank. It had established us firmly as proprietors of a life boat empire. It had said, in Queen's English, that we could never hold each other responsible for our actions. But there were other more problematic paragraphs, such as that which you were now studying:<br><br>
'From now until the end of time, we will love each other and abide by the terms of this contract, you read aloud. 
Then you were silent, and I counted the creases in your brow.
-I think it is no longer valid, you said at last. This line – 'the end of time' – I think that may have been the get out clause we knew we'd be looking for.<br><br>
Sadly, I stared past you. The dark clouds hung heavy outside our seventieth floor apartment. The storm would be a bad one. Already the waves were angry, tossing and turning as they carried their load of dead trees and drowned animals out to the horizon.
-But 'the end of time' is simply there to put stress on that forever, I said at last.<br><br>
-It seems, you said, that there are no forevers, and metaphors hold no weight anymore. Or at least I refuse to be weighed down by them any longer.<br><br>
I have become a student of that silence that reigns between us.
-Look, I didn't even sign it, you said eventually. Look at this signature – right here – it says it was signed by somone named 'Minnie Marlene, Queen of the Mice'. Who is this person? Who is this rodent monarch? Not I, anyway, surely not I.<br><br>
-I remember who held the pen?<br><br>
-Immaterial, you said. I do not remember writing that name and I fail to see any way by which you can convince me otherwise.<br><br>
-But<br><br>
-This is already confetti, you sighed sadly. Such a shame.<br><br>
-Yes, a shame, I echoed.<br><br>
Yet as you got to work on it, your eyes still held a dream.
You left to make drinks, and I thought of gathering up the pieces and, with a board and some glue, reassembling them. Yet, on investigaton, I found that you had been too thorough in your labours – here there was no chance of pasting back together the pieces of our covenant, no possibility of reconstruction.<br><br>
You had left confetti for me, I guess. You had fullfilled, I guess, our other earlier pact. We had made a youthful promise – to take the totality of all things into our hands, and in a gesture, make confetti out of everything. It had seemed like a wonderful promise to make. But now we are beginning to make confetti out of ourselves. The contract was only another inveitability. It was just another piece of our history to be torn and discarded, cast on the wind with the dustbins and the flowers.<br><br> 
It is evening now. I sit and write by my great desk of deleterious study that we bought from the former president of the sunken Irish republic. I am trying to keep ahead of you – manufacturing more, so that you do not run out of things to tear apart. You are more than encouraging, bringing me jiu1 glasses and hand rolled cigarettes to ease the nightfall.<br><br>
-A great writer must also be a great drunk, you have become fond of telling me. In this there may be something to cling to. Though they retard greatly any kind of progress, your whisky glasses do go some way in sedating the anxiety that grips me whenever I am want to take up a pen and paper and begin inscribing these these little dilemmas known as words.<br><br>
I feel that time has been kind to us – in a fashion, just as it has in equal proportion been cruel. It finds us living now with Matthew, our old and insane friend. Our home is a ruined palace in the clouds. It took us an adventure, for sure, but the three of us are reunited at last, after some fashion or other. We are seven hundred metres above sea level. But the waves are ineluctably rising, and this number diminishes by the day. Your chief concern now, is with the calculation of how long it will take those waves to reach the edges of our sky terrace. Matthew spends his time praying for our salvation, and writing his curious thoughts down in the guise of religious texts. My habits are sporadic – but I am trying to maintain the lifestyle of a retiring gentlemen: drinking heavily in the morning, advancing my arduous study of Sein und Zeit2, polishing the gun barrels in my gun closet, and playing sophisticated games with myself by the fireside, where we are slowly burning all of our books.<br><br>
Have we achieved, finally, a certain measure of success with our lives? I am often disposed to think so – when it is long past bedtime and I am pacing back and forth beneath the statues in our grand foyer. We have, for our purposes, requisitioned the seventieth floor corner suite in this ghastly building full of horrors. Our master bedroom commands a royal view twixt the skelletons of two burnt out financial towers. Our drawing room is fit for the entertainment of aristocracy.<br><br> The oaken long table in our dining room could easily seat seventy guests. We are not without consumables either. The wine closet is stocked with all the great vintages that remain of our age. There is enough mutton in our cavernous freezer to last two more winters, and our liquor cabinet holds enough jiu to warm one hundered more boozy nights. We have availed of all of this, because at one point or another we came into a vast fortune. Yet these are markers of a wealth that has has ceased to have much significance. <br><br>
Now that you have torn up our contract, I find myself thinking that success at the end of history can be measured only in how far one has managed to situate oneself above the sea. This is a grand truth that had previously eluded me. I remember now that when we fired the butler he begged to stay on and work for free – even going so far as to suggest what amounted to a cruel reduction in his butler rations of wine and table scraps. He had come to value the height above all else, and it was as if really we were paying him in altitude and altitude alone. He was forced, I think, to go and seek gainful employment lower down in the building, from those less fortuante than us – from those who are less endowed with height. Yet everything is running out, even the distance, and mayhaps I must concede that height isn't all that is left by which to judge this life. There are other things – more abstract ghosts – that I feel mute the quiet mumblings in my heart of some kind of dionysian joy.<br><br>
I remember things clearer now, in the light of what you have just done. That violence against the page lets this the circumstances of this awful timeline we are upon breathe clearer. Now I can see now that some things will forever be true. We were born at the end of history. That is unquestionable. Yet despite the circumstance and the promise of our birth, we were left to grow old in the Future. It was their history, and thus it was their future too. What a time it was. You have told me all about it. My God. What a time.<br><br> 
In the Future, there were sky trains and there were sky cities. The sea levels were rising grimly year on year, and in response our economies behaved like small animals on crack. Every five years we were forced to vote on whether or not we we wanted to continue the moratorium on democracy, and we had learned long ago that it was better for everyone to just say yes.<br><br> Our cities were beautiful and sad –a pathetic thrusting of hope above the water. There were zones dedicated to such acts as free trade, free love, free housing and free vice. We were running out of plains on which to build our wind farms. We were running out of rivers to dam and drip for drinking water, and there was less and less ebony gold to burn through the long hours without sunshine. Despite the rising tides, there were less and less fresh seas into which to pump our excess. At dusk, we would stand on balconies and sky train platforms, and we would see enormous flashes in the night, just as waking in dazes, we would hear great crashes of sound strike the mornings. There were mountain peaks on the horizons, but we could not seem them for the smog, and there were dances and riots on the skybridges and the skywalks. Drugs were freely available, but you had to pay for that ineffable thing called quality. Above all, we were everyday confusing two things – our love and our fascination. There were earthquakes beneath our feet, and our jiubas3 and sky bureaus would shake in harmony. That was their future, all of this. It is disappearing now as Mother Nature collects her debts from civilization. It is dissapearing – all of this – except that as night closes in, a gentle rain often still peters down through the perforated clouds.<br><br>
