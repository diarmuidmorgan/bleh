Hansel and Gretel are alive and well<br>
And they're living in Berlin<br>
She is a cocktail waitress<br>
He had a part in a Fassbinder film<br><br>

And they sit around at night now<br>
Drinking schnapps and gin<br>
And she says, 'Hansel, you're really bringing me down.'<br>
And he says, 'Gretel, you can really be a bitch.'<br><br>

He says, I've wasted my life on our stupid legend<br>
When my one and only love was the wicked witch<br><br>

She said, What is history?<br>
And he said, History is an angel<br>
Being blown<br>
Backwards<br>
Into the future<br>
He said: History is a pile of debris<br>
And the angel wants to go back and fix things<br>
To repair the things that have been broken<br><br>

But there is a storm blowing from Paradise<br>
And the storm keeps blowing the angel<br>
Backwards<br>
Into the future</p>

        <p1 class="contentbox"> "I cannot leave Bell Labs without mentioning one more device
which I saw there, and which haunts me as it haunts everyone who
has ever seen it in action. It is the Ultimate Machine—the End of
the Line. Beyond it there is Nothing. It sits on Claude Shannon’s
desk driving people mad. Nothing could look simpler. It is merely
a small wooden casket the size and shape of a cigar box, with
a single switch on one face. When you throw the switch, there
is an angry, purposeful buzzing. The lid slowly rises, and from
beneath it emerges a hand. The hand reaches down, turns the
switch off, and retreats into the box. With the finality of a closing
coffin, the lid snaps shut, the buzzing ceases, and peace reigns
once more. The psychological effect, if you do not know what to
expect, is devastating. There is something unspeakably sinister
about a machine that does nothing—absolutely nothing—except
switch itself off. Distinguished scientists and engineers have taken
days to get over it. Some have retired to professions which still
had a future, such as basket weaving, beekeeping, truffle hunting,
or water divining."</p1>
